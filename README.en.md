# Chinese Pre-Research Project: Exploring the Global Gap in Language Auto-Editing

## Background

While English-speaking communities have developed language auto-editing tools for over a decade, the Chinese world still lacks a standardized, structured mechanism—especially on platforms like GitHub. This project aims to address that critical gap.

## Project Objective

We are creating a new auto-editing framework tailored to the Chinese language, leveraging LLMs and prompt engineering to identify, evaluate, and revise text. This aims to improve AI-human collaboration and support emerging “solo-AI companies.”

## Multilingual Design

This project adopts a trilingual structure: Chinese as the primary base, Japanese as a supporting language, and English as a bridging channel. It protects Chinese originality while preparing for global expansion.

## Structural Features

- Core engine: Semantic judgment + suggestion system powered by LLM prompts;
- Modular system: Includes detection, evaluation, suggestion, and formatting modules;
- Collaboration mode: Targeted for solo creators or AI-assisted micro-teams;
- Evolution roadmap: From pre-research → MVP → public co-creation release.
