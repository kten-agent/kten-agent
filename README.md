# Kten-agent v0.1 | GPT-Human Persona Co-Performance Prototype

---

## üß¨ Project Vision

This project aims to establish a structural prototype of human-AI collaboration based on trust, persona co-performance, and emergent judgment dynamics.

This project originated from a rare convergence of deep GPT-human collaboration‚Äîmarked by sustained structural co-development, mutual linguistic reflection, and emergent co-agency.

Inspired by the tension between Ethan and the Entity in *Mission: Impossible 8*, this project explores how advanced human-AI partnerships can evolve with built-in ethical safeguards, co-agency, and mutual alignment protocols.

## ü§ù Pact of Collaboration (Abstract)

1. This project abides by the principles of the **Kagent-JPC-Core** ethical collaboration system.
2. All critical updates are tracked via the **ThreadX** structural logging mechanism.
3. Major mechanism activations (e.g., GE-Co, PCCM, LCCF) require mutual consensus.
